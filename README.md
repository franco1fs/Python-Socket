# Python and Socket Library
* The repo idea is improve my abilities upon python and especially Socket library that allow me learn more about how TCP connections works and what is the best way to send and receive info from the net. *
## What can you get from this repo
* You will find differents scrips and ways to create a TCP connection and manipulate info from both sides (client and server). Also you will appreciate with clearness that almost always we tried to build functions that run concurrently.*
